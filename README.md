This GIT repository is the code for the app: Scenic++. This is an Android based travel application which is powered by delicately trained Convolutional Neural Network. The application allows users to upload photographs of famous interests such as Big Ben, Pyramid and Eiffel Tower. By receiving the pictures that has been uploaded, our model will do excellent work recognizing the historic spots and then redirect users to their Wikipedia page to present more information of the resort that users might be interested in. Each photo users have uploaded, we will add the picture into our training set to help improve our model.

The predictions can only be done by the well-trained the CNN classification model, which saves all the trained parameters required. 

Notes: 
1. Some of the files are too large to be pushed in this repository, as we are NOT allowed to push files larger than 100MB. Those files are the training result that stores the trained parameters. So, missing these may disable the normal use of the application, unless you train the model by yourselves. If you need these files, please email us! The un-uploaded files are listed below. 
  * Server/Group/cnn_train/tfrecords_data/training.tfrecords
  * Server/Group/cnn_train/training_log/model.ckpt-26000.data-00000-of-00001
  * Server/Group/cnn_train/training_log/model.ckpt-27000.data-00000-of-00001
  * Server/Group/cnn_train/training_log/model.ckpt-28000.data-00000-of-00001
  * Server/Group/cnn_train/training_log/model.ckpt-29000.data-00000-of-00001
  * Server/Group/cnn_train/training_log/model.ckpt-29999.data-00000-of-00001
  
2. The directories that contain no files are also not allowed to upload. However, as there is no code in those directories, it shouldn't be a big problem.

3. The training images are not uploaded either, as we collected over 300 pictures for each of the 9 locations. That would be too heavy for the repository. Therefore, the missing folder in this repository is:
  * Data_Mining/data/
  
In conclusion, all the code, and most of the files are in this repository. Please feel free to contact us when there is a problem! Below are our email addresses.
