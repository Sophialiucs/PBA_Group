Notes: 
1. Some of the files are too large to be pushed in this repository, as we are not allowed to push files larger than 100MB. Those files are the training result that stores the trained parameters. So, missing these would disable the normal use of the application. The un-uploaded files are listed below. If you need these files, please email us!
  * Server/Group/cnn_train/tfrecords_data/training.tfrecords
  * Server/Group/cnn_train/training_log/model.ckpt-26000.data-00000-of-00001
  * Server/Group/cnn_train/training_log/model.ckpt-27000.data-00000-of-00001
  * Server/Group/cnn_train/training_log/model.ckpt-28000.data-00000-of-00001
  * Server/Group/cnn_train/training_log/model.ckpt-29000.data-00000-of-00001
  * Server/Group/cnn_train/training_log/model.ckpt-29999.data-00000-of-00001
  
2. The directories that contain no files are also not allowed to upload. However, as there is no code in those directories, it shouldn't be a big problem.

3. The training images are not uploaded either, as we collected over 300 pictures for each of the 9 locations. That would be too heavy for the repository. Therefore, the missing folder in this repository is:
  * Data_Mining/data/
  
In conclusion, all the code, and most of the files are in this repository. Please feel free to contact us when there is a problem! Below are our email addresses.
